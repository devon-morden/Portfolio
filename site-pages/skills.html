          <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
          <dt>Five Whys</dt>
          <dd>As a former teacher and certified instructional designer, it has been my job to ask questions. Whether students or executives, one of the most meaningful things we can say is 'Please explain that to me.'</dd>

          <dt>Data</dt>
          <dd>While asking 'why' can be an excellent way to get the conversation heading the right direction, it is also important to keep ourselves objective by checking our assumptions against data when it is available. I was a data-driven teacher, and my experience in marketing has only solidified my data analysis skills.</dd>

          <dt>Active Listening</dt>
          <dd>Understanding a user's experience hinges critically on one's ability to listen <span style="font-style: italic">actively</span>. I not only completed training in active listening as part of my role as a student advisor, I also completed Jen Cort's Challenging Conversations training as I took on the role of Middle School Diversity Coordinator. <span style="font-style: italic">That</span> was a role that required strong active listening skills as I worked with students and parents from a wide variety of backgrounds and beliefs to create an age-appropriate environment and educational experience that afforded safe classroom and extracurricular interactions during a period of intensely polarized politics social conflict.</dd>

          <dt>Formal Training</dt>
          <dd>As part of my coursework in learning experience design, I practiced UX research, UX design, and UI design. All of these skills are crucial to the development of quality learning experiences.</dd>

          <h3>Project Management</h3>

          <dt>Formal Training</dt>
          <dd>As part of my certification in instructional design, I learned to work with both waterfall and agile approaches to project management and development. Within the field of instructional design, the waterfall approach is frequently represented through the acronym ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate). While this is the traditional approach to project managment in instructional design, it can hit major road bumps when design change requests arise halfway through the development stage. Instructional Designers are increasingly moving towards agile approaches like SAM (successive approximation model). All of these formats were covered extensively through my certification, and I have gone on to complete two additional courses in project management.</dd>

          <dt>Experience</dt>
          <dd>From curriculum development, to managing a website upgrade project, to organizing a two week camping event for nearly one hundred people, I have been defining problems, developing business cases, managing budgets, planning, and evaluating lessons learned through out my career. You can learn more about this experience on my <a href="/site-pages/work.html">Examples of Work page</a>.</dd>

          <h3>Web Design</h3>
          <p>Over the last year, I have been developing my web-design skills. I have written all of the code for this site - html, css, and vanilla js, and continue to grow in this field. Through my work in SEO and instructional design, I have developed a passion for good user experience and design, and I am building the skill set to be able to offer that from the first identification of the problem to the digital experience that provides the solution. I am keenly focused on accessibility, SEO, and clear code. You can view this portfolio's code and development on my <a href="https://github.com/devon-morden/portfolio" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
          <p>*This website is still in its alpha stage. There are still some formatting bugs, and I have not yet added aria markup nor completed performance and SEO optimization. Please <a href="mailto:devon.r.morden@gmail.com">ask me questions</a> about this site!</p>

          <h3>Instructional Design</h3>
          <p>I received my certificate in Instructional Design from Oregon State University in the Spring of 2022, and have continued my professional development through Connie Malamed's Mastering Instructional Design course and ELVTR's Instructional Design course with Lianna Griffin. I am competent in Articulate 360 and advanced PowerPoint, and I have a broad familiarity with LMSs and SCORM compliance/APIs.</p>
